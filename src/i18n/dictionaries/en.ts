      "In November 2024 in Kyiv the world premiere of “CREONTE” was performed in concert form after 250 years of silence. Under the baton of Herman Makarenko — UNESCO Artist for Peace — the masterpiece was heard with the National Presidential Orchestra and the National Academic Cappella of Ukraine ‘Dumka’. Lead roles: Sergiy Bortnyk (Creonte), Honored Artist of Ukraine Olha Fomichova (Antigona), Danylo Kotok (Emon), Stanislav Pashchuk (Adrast), Marharyta Bilokiz (Ismena). A highlight was the harpsichord part reconstructed and first performed by musicologist and head of the Early Music Department Olha Shadrina-Lychak.",
      "“The premiere of ‘CREONTE’ is not merely an artistic event; it is a bridge between centuries that reconnects us with our past and helps us better understand ourselves. We reclaim our cultural heritage — and thus hope and strength for our people and future generations,” noted Ukraine’s Minister for Foreign Affairs Andrii Sybiha in his greeting.",
